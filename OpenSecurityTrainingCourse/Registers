Registers are small memory storage areas built into the processor
-volatile 
-16 genral purpose registers + instruction point which points at the next instruction to execute
-2/16 are not general
-x86-32 registers are 32 bits wide
-x86-64 registers are 64 bits wide

8008: 8 bit A register only
16-bit 8086: AX register (A extended) that can access AH (A high) and AL (A low) ==> RW -Word
32-bit 80386: EAX register ( AX extended) that can access AH and AL sub-registers of AX ==> R0D-Double word
64-bit: RAX register (R0 or Really extended EAX) ==> R0
