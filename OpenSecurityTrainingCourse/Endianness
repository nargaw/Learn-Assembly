Endianness: (Gulliver's Travels)
-storage into RAM - little end first
-0x12345678 -> intel: 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12

-network traffic: Big Endian 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78
-Endianness applies to memory
-Endianness applies to bytes not bits (8 bit segments)
-one byte not affected 

-Little Endian (intel): least significant byte goes into low memory address
-Big Endian (others): most significant byte goes into low memory address
