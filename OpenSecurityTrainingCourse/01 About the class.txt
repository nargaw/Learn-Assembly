X86 Assembly
-8086: 16 bit
-backward compatibility by intel chips
-move to 64 bit - Itanium
-extended to x86 to 64 

x86-64 used:
-Most desktop systems, servers and super-computers


-translation from c to asm
-only 14 assembly instructions account for 90% of code
-knowing 20-30 assembly instruction is good enough

outcome:
-learn x86-64 gen purpose registers and their 32 and 16 bit sub-registers
-local var or return addresses are stored on the stack
-understand function calls
-write c code in an IDE and step through and see the disassembly
-Final Binary Bomb Lab: final test
